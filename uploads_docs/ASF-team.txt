Lily Davis is our Regional Rep for all New England. She's out with medical issues now and I've been filling in as best I can. Which is how I uncovered all these issues and got the thought that maybe there could be a better, simpler way to have more consistent, better info to work with. The inconsistencies create lots of communication issues and frustration. My feeling is that if we had a system and way to use tools we could handle a greater volume of dogs and also recruit/train more volunteers. Lily should copied on all communications.
